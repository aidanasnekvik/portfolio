        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Aidana, a UI & graphic designer based in Norway. I believe good design should be beautiful – but more importantly, it should make sense. I aim to create interfaces that are intuitive, visually pleasing, and easy to navigate, so people can feel confident using them without overthinking.</p>
        <p>My experience in content creation and branding has shaped how I approach design with both empathy and intention. Though I’m still early in my professional journey, I’m constantly learning and refining my craft – and I’m excited to keep growing.</p>
